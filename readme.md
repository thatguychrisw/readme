An intro to how I approach managing teams, my values, and what to expect when working with me.  It's a starting point to help us build a relationship more quickly.

## My values
1. People first
2. Well-being matters
3. Invest in yourself
4. Over-communicate

## How I define my job

## Continuous feedback

## The work/home balance

## We are problem-solvers; not code monkeys

## Strong opinions, weakly held

## One owner (DRI)

## Meetings should be useful

## Testing grants confidence

## Observability is important
