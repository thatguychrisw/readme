## What this is
An intro to how I approach managing teams, my values, and what to expect when working with me.  It's a starting point to help us build a relationship more quickly.

## My values
1. **People first** – everyone matters and we should foster an inclusive, caring culture that regards people's well-being and success as a priority.
2. **Well-being matters** — maintain an emotionally safe work environment, free from humiliation, aggression, or manipulation.
3. **Invest in yourself** — always be curious, ask questions, and share what you learn with others.
4. **Proactively communicate** — this builds trust and relationships by learning and understanding the needs of others.

## How I define my job

## The work/home balance

## We are problem-solvers; not code monkeys

## Strong opinions, weakly held

## One owner (DRI)

## Meetings should be useful

## Testing grants confidence

## Observability is important
