## What this is
An intro to how I approach managing teams, my values, and what to expect when working with me.  It's a starting point to help us build a relationship more quickly.

## My values
1. **People first** – everyone matters and we should foster an inclusive, caring culture that regards people's well-being and success as a priority.
2. **Psychological safety** — maintain an emotionally safe work environment  where team members feel accepted and respected.
3. **Invest in yourself** — always be curious, ask questions, and share what you learn with others.
4. **Proactively communicate** — this builds trust and relationships by learning and understanding the needs of others.

## How I view my job
I believe in servant oriented leadership, helping others find solutions to problems by leveraging their strengths. I am measured by the outcomes of my team, therefore it is in my best interest to make sure my teams have the necessary context in order to succeed. I value honest, open communication, and promise to ensure a safe space where each team member feels accepted and respected.

## The work/home balance

## We are problem-solvers; not code monkeys
We are paid to solve problems, not just write code.  I encourage people to think creatively about how to best solve the problem at hand.  There are times where the best option is perhaps a 3rd party tool, a contract change, or manually managed process. 

I encourage people to think creatively about how to best solve the problem at hand. Often the best option is to not write code at all - perhaps a contract change, customer conversation, or 3rd party tool might be a cheaper long-term solution.
